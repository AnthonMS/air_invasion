<h1> Air Invasion </h1>

Air Invasion is a mobile game I am developing with 3 other students from my class. 
The title is not going to be Air Invasion, but we have not figured out what to call it.

It is about a Lumberjack walking up in the mountains, when he suddenly gets attacked by some angry birds. The birds then both attack him with poop, but also by flying into his head, like a kamikaze plane. You will start with throwing stones and then when you progress through the mountains you will eventually get weapon upgrades. There are stages/tiers, and when you advance a stage, the birds will get more heath and do more damage. But before they do that, there will be a mini boss fight. Right now it is just a small green dragon.

Screenshots on it's way.
 If you want to follow out progress I have made a website that I put on Google Cloud, I have not been able to get a Domain to work with it yet. But if you wan't to see some screenshots and follow out progress, you can do so by following this link -> http://35.230.134.132/
